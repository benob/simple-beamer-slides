=== First section ===

--- Bullets ---

Bullets start with * and are based on alignment
* Bullet 1
* Bullet 2
  * Second level of bullets

Enumerations with with \# and dotted numbers
# Enum 1
# Enum 2
  1. Second level of enum (numeric)
  2. Even more enum
(some text in the item)

Some text after the bullets

--- Simple text stuff ---

Make italics with _underscores like this_.

Make bold with *stars like this*.

Urls like http://www.google.com get recognized.

The => symbol is changed to an arrow

The > sign is wrapped in maths

--- Maths ---

Simple inline math: $a+b+c$

Multiline math is an align environment (starts and ends with a single dollar on the line)

$
a & b \\
c & d
$

Fancy stuff in math:
* No need for curly brackets in simple exponents/indices $a_10ab, a^11, b^(i+1)$
* * is turned to times in $a * b$.
* ... is turned to dots $a...b$.
* @ makes the next symbol bold, ($@y, @\lambda, @x^i$ is a vector).

--- Verbatim ---

You can include a verbatim section

\begin{verbatim}
This is verbatim content {} * %$#
\end{verbatim}

% this is a comment
Comments start with \%.

--- Images ---

Images are centered, the number before \# tells the percentage of the width to use:
