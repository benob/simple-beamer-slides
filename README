Simple Beamer Slides
====================
Benoit Favre <benoit.favre@lif.univ-mrs.fr>

This converter allows to write slides with a wiki-like syntax and convert them
to beamer/latex for a nice pdf rendering.  While many projects provide
converters from markup languages to slides, this one is specifically tailored
towards making life with beamer easier.  See format.slides (and corresponding
format.pdf) for an overview of capabilities and syntax sugar provided.

Current features:
* inclusion of latex commands
* slide and section markers
* title page and outline
* bullet lists an enumerations
* math sugar
* graphics
* urls

Planned features:
* code highlighting
* more sugar

A vim syntax coloring scheme is provided in slides.vim, simply put that file
in ~/.vim/syntax and add this line to your .vimrc file:

au BufRead,BufNewFile *.slides setfiletype slides
